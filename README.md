HAHA that means peepee...

## READ ME BEEYATCH
Use the `Releases` on the right side (or whever github moves it to in the future) to get the latest "good to go" release of Tinkle.

If there isn't a version yet, then you're too early. Wait until I've finished at least v1 :P

## FAQ

### **Why is it called "Tinkle"?**
Funny init fam

### **Why is it written in JavaScript instead of Typescript?**
Because TypeScript is a bitch and refuses to compile correctly for me in a way that FiveM will accept.
If I can ever fix that issue, then I'll switch - simple.

### **What does Tinkle do?**
Whatever we (TopHat) need it to do really. Rather than doing most logic *in* FiveM, we can do it outside and then just feed that data back.
It makes iteration of development and storing data a lot easier, and gives an easier path for future integration with external applications.

### **Seriously, why is it called "Tinkle"?**
Tinkle is the company name in the HD Universe of GTA. Primarily a a Mobile Phones and Tele-communications provider, we chose the name because the company was loosely related to electronics and it was funny.

### **Can I use it?**
You can try I guess, I'm too busy to offer support and I'm still building tinkle so it's constantly changing.
You'll also probably need the API, which is closed-source for the time being... soz.
